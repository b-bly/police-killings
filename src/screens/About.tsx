        <p><strong>Calculations</strong>: </p>
        <p><strong>Risk</strong>: the times more likely a black person is to die in a police encounter than a white person.  
          This was calculated as follows:
        </p>
        <p className="calculation">ratio of black : white deaths / black : white population ratio</p>
        <p className="calculation">(number of black deaths  / number of white deaths) / (black population / white population)</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>For example, in Los Angeles County, there were 245 black deaths and 200 white deaths between January 1, 2000 and July 20, 2020.</p>
        <p>The population of black people is 811,476.  The population of whites is 5,184,112.</p>
        <p className="calculation">(245 / 200) / (811,476 / 5,184,112)  = 7.83 
        </p>
        <p className="calculation">A black person is 7.83 times more likely to die in an encounter 
        with the police than a white person.
